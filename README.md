# DSA in Java

Welcome to my DSA in Java repository! This repository is designed to help me master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. It contains a comprehensive collection of notes, assignments, and practice questions that align with the lectures and learning materials which I am following.

## Contents
1. Lecture Notes: Detailed notes from each lecture, covering key concepts, explanations, and examples.
2. Assignments: A variety of assignments designed to reinforce the concepts learned in lectures.
3. Practice Questions: A curated set of questions to test and enhance understanding, ranging from basic to advanced levels.
